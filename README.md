# SpellingBeeHelper

Can't come up with words for the NYT spelling bee? Look no further than this interactive helper!

## How to Use
Run .exe program. Program takes a moment to load
Once you see the 'Ready to Use' message, began typing any combination of letters to get output
You can specify the number of letters by clicking the # sign on your keyboard to determine the maximum length of each word that will be outputted.
By default, words of max length 5 are outputted only.
Exit the program by clicking the 'esc' key

Over 32 thousand words! (And the program doesn't run slow at all >:))
